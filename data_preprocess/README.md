We preprocess MIMIC-III by first querying the raw **vitals** and **admissions** tables, then isolating each ICU stay (`icustay_id`) as an independent sample. For every stay we extract seven routinely recorded signals—heart-rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and urine output—resample them to an equal 1-hour grid, and truncate or zero-pad so every sample is a fixed **24 × 7** time-series matrix covering the first 24 hours in the unit. We attach a binary in-hospital mortality label from the admissions record, stack all samples into a single array, randomly shuffle, and split 80 % / 20 % into training and test sets while reporting the class balance. This yields a clean, length-aligned dataset ready for downstream modeling without exposing any protected health information.
